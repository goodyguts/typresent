          <h2>What are types 🤔</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Let's start basic, what are types?</p>

            <p>
              You guys will already be vaguely familiar with types from SQL. In
              SQL tables, each column has a data type.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The first column is a name, which is text, and we call this data
                type "string".
              </li>
              <li>The second column is a date.</li>
              <li>
                The third column is a true or false value, which we call
                boolean.
              </li>
              <li>
                The fourth column has height, which is a number with a decimal
                point. We'll call this float, which stands for "floating point".
                You will sometimes hear this called "double".
              </li>
              <li>
                Finally, we have a whole number, which I'll call integer,
                because that is the standard name for whole numbers in
                computing. Obviously the number of children a person has is a
                whole number - unless you accepted an offer from King Solomon in
                the bible.
              </li>
            </ul>

            Whenever a computer has a bit of data, it knows what type it is, and
            types are important. Depending on what the type of something is the
            computer can do different things!

              So this flexibility is cool and all, but without guardrails, you

            Another related issue. When you are using code editors, they can
            normally be very helpful with things like autocomplete. However,
            since there is no way of knowing what function parameters actually
            are, code editors can't really help you in python. (click) So here
            we can see VSCode letting us know that it has no idea what this

              The old solution to this problem, it was the solution at google,

              variable should be in the docstring (click). I mean it's fine. You
              now make fewer errors.
            </p>
            <p>
              This solution is better than the alternative, but I don't love it.
              It's a lot of characters. It does nothing to help your code editor
              understand the types. Python, in built, has a better way.

          <h2>Type annotations 🥳</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              The solution I recommend is called type annotations. So here
              (click) is how you define the type for a variable, with simple
              types. You just put a colon after the variable name and you say
              what the type actually is. int for integer, bool for boolean.
            </p>
            <p>
              And (click) it's officially part of Python since Python 3.7, so it
              should just work. How do you write more complex types? (next)

          <h2>More complex annotations</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            How do you do the more complex types? Well it depends. If I have a
            list of integers, I can write this (click). If I have a dictionary
            of strings to floats I can do this (click). If I have a DataFrame,
            you can do the below (click). There are also a way to represent a
            combination of types. So with this union thing, the type of x is an
            int *or* a string. Note, for some of these to work you need Python
            3.9 or above - so keep that in mind.

              Just to give you a challenge, here is a complex object with a
              complex type (click). I'm going to give everyone a moment to
              decide what type they think this should have. 3, 2, 1. Okay, so
              this is a dictionary, and it maps strings to lists of integers. So
              the type is (click) dict[str, int[list]].
            </p>
            <p>
              Types are complex, and I don't want to go fully into the
              intricacies, so we'll leave how to write the type definitions
              there for now.

          <h2>Type annotations on functions</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              The most important place we use type annotations is on functions.
              In functions we can define the types of the parameters and also
              the return type of the function.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's look at our example from earlier, but with types (click).
              It's pretty easy no? After each parameter you put a colon, then
              you put the type of that parameter. For the return type, you put a
              line and a chevron to make an arrow, then you put the return type.
              This function returns nothing so we put None. In my opinion that's
              a much neater way to show the types of each of the parameters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's look at a slightly more complicated function. This function
              takes a list of integers and an integer multiplier, then returns a
              new list where each item in the list has been multipled by that
              number. Here (click) is that function, with the type definition.
            </p>
            <p>
              This function that I have written uses a list comprehension, which
              I would recommend learning if you're properly getting into python.

          <h2>It's optional and not enforced</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              Type definitions are optional and they are also not enforced when
              you run the code.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                (click) You can just not put a type definition for anything,
                that's still allowed. And you're allowed a mix.
              </li>
              <li>
                (click) You can just straight up lie, and there won't be an
                error when you run this program. But you shouldn't.
              </li>
              <li>
                (click) In an equal vein, you're free to ignore instructions. If
                a function says to give it an integer and you want to give it a
                string cos you feel like it, that's your perogative.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can do all these things if you have low enough morals. Since
              it is optional and isn't enforced, the type annotations are
              essentailly just a form of documentation - and we all know that
              RAP is about good documentation.
            </p>
            <p>But this documentation is better than a simple comment.</p>

          <h2>It shows if you hover your mouse in VSCode</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              So you may or may not know that when you hover over a function in
              VSCode, it shows the docstring. It also shows the type annotation.
              So in this way the type annotation is good documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now's a good time to mention that you need to have the python
              extension turned on in VSCode for this all to work. Also, if you
              use spyder, spyder doesn't do a lot of this, so change to VSCode.

            <h2>Autocomplete</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
              Also, VSCode understands type annotations, and so VSCode can now
              autocomplete many things for you in the function. In this example,
              because VSCode knows that numbers is a list, it knows that it has
              the append method. So when I type numbers.app, it can recommend to
              finish it off with append, and it also gives me the docstring of
              the append method. (click)

          <section>
            <aside class="notes">
              The autocomplete works with the return types as well. Because
              VSCode knows the return here is a dataframe, it can recommend me
              the reset_index method.

          <h2>Static type checking</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>
              For the absolute final final thing. I said that the type checks
              weren't enforced. This means that even if the type hints are
              wrong, the python will still run. However, you can get VSCode to
              check the types for you without you running the code!
            </p>
            <p>
              This is called static type checking. Static means that the code
              isn't run. You have to turn on a setting (click) here, it is an
              opt in feature, but it comes with the python extension.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we look at that example from earlier - look! It spots the
              error! We get an error that says the type is incompatible when we
              hover our mouse.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are actually tools out there that can run type checking
              analysis on all of your code. That means you can run them before
              you commit your code, to spot mistakes you might have missed. The
              most famous of those tools is called mypy. The one included in
              VSCode, made by microsoft, is called Pylance.

          <aside class="notes">
            So that's the end of my part of the presentation. I hope you now
            understand types a bit better, and I hope you start you start using
            type annotations throughout your code.
